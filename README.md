# Train Scheduler

Train Scheduler allows users to view different trains and their prospective destinations and arrival times. Users can also add their own train, destination, and the frequency of their stops.

[Try it yourself!](https://jakefen.github.io/trainScheduler/)

### Getting Started

The first think the user will see when they open the site is all the current trains and their destinations. Each train will also show when their next arrival time is and how frequent they stop. If the user wants to add their own train to the list, there's a form at the bottom they can fill out. Once they add their train and refresh the page, everyone will be able to enjoy that train!
